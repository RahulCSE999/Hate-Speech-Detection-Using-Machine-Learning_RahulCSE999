# Future Scope
We can use it on Social media like Facebook,  Instagram etc. to find the people which are used hate speech and offensive words in comments. Sometimes they use very bad comments which can harm a people. So in future by using Hate Speech Detection Using ML we can make social media platform more realistic. 
We can add feature like if a man are using hate speech words on someone post any social media platform then the detection model detect it and it will showed a pop up on the commenter people this is hate speech if you want to do you have to provide some details like government ID. 
If the commenter do not provide details He / She can comment. If they provided government ID details and do hate speech then message will go to the that user account on which commenter do hate speech. So user can easily find that commenter and can do a legal action against that commenter.
